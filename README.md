### Hi there, i'm karo :owl:.


- I'm currently studying computer science at LMU, Germany.
- I've been studying reinforcement learning and working on my bachelor's thesis. I'm open to any internship or student assistant opportunities this summer and beyond.
- :sleepy: Study to survive. Girl run away fast as you can.
